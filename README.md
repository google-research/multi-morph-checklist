# Multilingual Morphological Checklist (M2C)

This repo contains code and data that enable the creation of targeted behavioral
tests in a diverse set of languages.

## What is behavioral testing?

Behavioral testing, also known as black-box testing, is a practice from software
testing that examines a system without knowing its internals. Specifically, we
test a system's capabilities solely based on how the system responds to specific
inputs.

In our setting, a test consists of a context and a question and we determine whether
a language model passes the test based on its answer.

## Framework

Our framework consists of three stages:

1. Template creation: A user creates a template and placeholders that test a capability in a specific language.
2. Test generation: Tests are generated based on the template and placeholders according to morphological rules.
3. Model evaluation: A model is evaluated on the generated tests.

### Template creation

A user provides a template as a string, a list of values for each place-holder, and an optional configuration dictionary in case of duplicate placeholders.
The placeholder values can either be passed without inflections (for example, names in English) as a list of strings, or as a list of dictionaries with dimension attributes as keys and corresponding inflections as values.

### Test generation

Tests are generated for each template by substituting values for each placeholder based on their morphological attributes.

### Model evaluation

Models are fed each test as input and produce an output. The output is compared to the gold answers for each test using string matching and regex.
